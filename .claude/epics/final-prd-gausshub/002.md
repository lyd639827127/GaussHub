# Core API Framework & Business Logic

## Objective
Build the core Express.js API framework with essential business logic for managing research papers, user interactions, and platform operations.

## Scope
- Express.js server setup with proper middleware stack
- RESTful API endpoints for all core functionality
- Paper upload, processing, and management system
- User profile and preference management
- Notification system
- API rate limiting and security measures
- Error handling and logging system
- API documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger)

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Express.js server is properly configured with security middleware
- [ ] RESTful API endpoints are implemented for all core features
- [ ] Paper upload system handles PDF files and extracts metadata
- [ ] User profile management is fully functional
- [ ] Notification system can send alerts and updates
- [ ] API rate limiting prevents abuse
- [ ] Comprehensive error handling covers all edge cases
- [ ] API documentation is complete and accessible
- [ ] All endpoints are properly tested
- [ ] Request/response validation is implemented

## Technical Requirements
- Express.js 4.x framework
- Multer for file uploads
- Helmet for security headers
- Rate limiting middleware
- Request validation (joi or similar)
- Winston for logging
- Swagger/OpenAPI documentation
- PDF processing capabilities
- Email notification system

## Dependencies
- Requires completion of task 001 (Database Schema & Authentication)
- Authentication middleware from task 001
- Database connections from task 001

## Deliverables
- Express.js server configuration
- Complete API endpoint implementations
- Business logic modules
- File upload and processing system
- Notification service
- API documentation
- Error handling middleware
- Logging configuration

## Notes
This task builds directly on the authentication foundation from task 001 and cannot begin until that infrastructure is in place. The API framework will serve as the backbone for the frontend application.
