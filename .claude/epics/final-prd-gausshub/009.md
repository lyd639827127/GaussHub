# Enterprise Integrations & Analytics Dashboard

## Objective
Integrate GaussHub with enterprise systems including CRM platforms, WeChat Work, and Single Sign-On (SSO) providers, while building a comprehensive analytics dashboard with real-time widgets for business intelligence.

## Scope
- CRM integration (Salesforce/HubSpot) with bidirectional data synchronization
- WeChat Work API integration for team collaboration and notifications
- Enterprise SSO implementation (OAuth 2.0/SAML) with existing identity providers
- Real-time analytics dashboard with customizable widgets
- Executive reporting system with automated insights
- Data pipeline for real-time metrics calculation
- Integration abstraction layer for multiple external systems
- Webhook management for real-time updates

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] CRM integration successfully syncs customer data bidirectionally with 99.9% accuracy
- [ ] WeChat Work integration enables notifications, approvals, and team collaboration
- [ ] SSO authentication works seamlessly with major identity providers (Azure AD, Okta, etc.)
- [ ] Analytics dashboard displays real-time metrics with <2 second refresh rates
- [ ] Widget system allows drag-and-drop customization of dashboard layouts
- [ ] Executive reports are generated automatically and delivered via email/WeChat
- [ ] Integration health monitoring alerts on failures or data sync issues
- [ ] All integrations handle rate limits and implement proper retry mechanisms
- [ ] Data synchronization maintains audit trails for compliance requirements
- [ ] Dashboard supports role-based data filtering and access controls

## Technical Requirements
- CRM API clients (Salesforce REST API, HubSpot API v3)
- WeChat Work Enterprise API integration
- OAuth 2.0 and SAML 2.0 authentication protocols
- Real-time dashboard with WebSocket connections
- Chart.js or D3.js for data visualization
- Redis for real-time metrics caching
- Event-driven architecture for data pipeline
- Webhook validation and security
- Rate limiting and API quota management
- Data transformation and mapping layers

## Dependencies
- Requires completion of task 002 (Core API Framework & Business Logic)
- Authentication system and user management from previous tasks
- Database schema must support external system data mapping
- Notification system integration points

## Deliverables
- CRM integration modules with sync capabilities
- WeChat Work API client and webhook handlers
- SSO authentication provider configurations
- Real-time analytics dashboard frontend
- Widget framework for customizable dashboards
- Executive reporting engine
- Integration monitoring and alerting system
- Data pipeline for metrics processing
- API documentation for all integrations
- Configuration management for multiple environments

## Notes
This task focuses on connecting GaussHub to the broader enterprise ecosystem. The integrations must be designed with reliability and scalability in mind, as they will handle business-critical data synchronization. The analytics dashboard serves as the primary business intelligence interface for executives and managers.
