# Epic: GaussHub - 3D Hall Sensor Market Enablement Platform

## Overview

GaussHub is a comprehensive enterprise platform that transforms 3D Hall sensor business operations through AI-enhanced knowledge management, intelligent ticket systems, and real-time business intelligence. The technical approach leverages proven open-source components with strategic AI integration to deliver a scalable, mobile-first solution that reduces customer response times by 40% and increases knowledge reuse by 60%.

**Core Value**: Transform fragmented tribal knowledge into a centralized, intelligent system that scales expertise across the organization while providing real-time business insights for strategic decision-making.

## Architecture Decisions

### Technology Stack Selection
- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript + Ant Design (enterprise-proven, mobile-responsive)
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express + Python FastAPI (JavaScript for business logic, Python for AI/analytics)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (primary) + Redis (cache/sessions) + Elasticsearch (search)
- **AI Services**: External APIs (Qwen/Gemini) rather than custom ML models
- **Deployment**: Docker + Kubernetes for scalability and reliability

### Key Architectural Patterns
- **API-First Design**: RESTful services with OpenAPI 3.0 documentation
- **Microservices Approach**: Separate services for tickets, knowledge, analytics, and AI
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Message queues for real-time updates and notifications
- **Progressive Web App**: Mobile-first design with offline capabilities
- **Multi-Tenant Security**: Role-based access control with data isolation

### Integration Strategy
- **CRM Integration**: Abstraction layer supporting Salesforce/HubSpot via standard APIs
- **Enterprise SSO**: OAuth 2.0/SAML integration with existing identity providers
- **WeChat Work**: Native API integration for team collaboration and notifications
- **File Storage**: S3-compatible object storage (MinIO) with CDN acceleration

## Technical Approach

### Frontend Components

**Core UI Framework**
- **Component Library**: Ant Design for consistent enterprise UI with custom theming
- **State Management**: Zustand for lightweight, TypeScript-first state management
- **Routing**: React Router v6 with code-splitting for performance
- **Mobile Support**: Responsive design with PWA capabilities for offline field use

**Key Interface Components**
- **Ticket Management**: Kanban-style boards with real-time updates via WebSocket
- **Knowledge Editor**: Rich text editor with multi-modal content support (images, videos, CAD files)
- **Search Interface**: Faceted search with auto-suggest and filters
- **Dashboard Widgets**: Customizable drag-and-drop dashboard with real-time charts
- **Mobile Checklists**: Touch-optimized validation workflows with offline sync

### Backend Services

**API Gateway & Authentication**
- **Gateway**: Express.js with rate limiting, request validation, and authentication middleware
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens with refresh rotation, enterprise SSO integration
- **Authorization**: Role-based permissions with resource-level access control
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive activity tracking for compliance requirements

**Core Business Services**
- **Ticket Service**: CRUD operations, state transitions, similarity matching, SLA tracking
- **Knowledge Service**: Content management, version control, review workflows, auto-categorization
- **Design Library Service**: Reference design catalog with parametric search and usage tracking
- **Analytics Service**: Real-time metrics calculation, trend analysis, predictive insights
- **Notification Service**: Multi-channel notifications (email, WeChat, in-app)

**Data Models & Schema**
```sql
-- Core entities with optimized indexing
Users: id, email, role, department, preferences
Tickets: id, title, description, status, priority, customer_id, product_series, created_at
Knowledge: id, title, content, category, tags, status, author_id, version, quality_score
Projects: id, name, customer_id, stage, application_domain, estimated_value
ChecklistRuns: id, template_id, project_id, results, passed, report_path
```

### Infrastructure

**Deployment Architecture**

**Monitoring and Observability**
- **Application Monitoring**: Prometheus metrics with Grafana dashboards
- **Error Tracking**: Centralized logging with structured JSON logs
- **Performance**: APM monitoring for API response times and database query performance
- **Alerts**: PagerDuty integration for critical system failures

**Security Implementation**
- **Data Encryption**: AES-256 encryption at rest and TLS 1.3 in transit
- **Network Security**: VPC with private subnets and security groups
