# Testing, Security & Deployment

## Objective
Establish comprehensive testing framework, implement security hardening measures, build robust CI/CD pipeline, and deploy GaussHub to production-ready Kubernetes environment with full monitoring and observability.

## Scope
- Comprehensive test suite (unit, integration, e2e, performance, security)
- Security hardening and vulnerability assessment
- CI/CD pipeline with automated testing and deployment
- Kubernetes deployment configuration with auto-scaling
- Production monitoring and observability stack
- Backup and disaster recovery procedures
- Performance optimization and load testing
- Security compliance validation (GDPR, CCPA)
- Documentation for operational procedures

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Test coverage reaches 80%+ for all business logic components
- [ ] Automated test suite runs in <10 minutes with parallel execution
- [ ] Security scan shows zero high-severity vulnerabilities
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline deploys to staging/production without manual intervention
- [ ] Kubernetes cluster supports 200+ concurrent users with auto-scaling
- [ ] Monitoring alerts are configured for all critical system metrics
- [ ] Application performance meets SLA requirements (95% requests <200ms)
- [ ] Backup system tested with successful disaster recovery simulation
- [ ] Security compliance audit passes with all requirements met
- [ ] Load testing validates system performance under peak loads
- [ ] All services have proper health checks and readiness probes
- [ ] Production deployment includes rollback mechanisms

## Technical Requirements
- Testing frameworks (Jest, Pytest, Cypress/Playwright for E2E)
- Security tools (OWASP ZAP, Snyk, SonarQube)
- CI/CD platform (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or Jenkins)
- Kubernetes 1.25+ with Helm charts
- Monitoring stack (Prometheus, Grafana, Jaeger)
- Log aggregation (ELK stack or similar)
- Load testing tools (K6, Artillery)
- Security scanning integration
- Container registry with vulnerability scanning
- Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, Pulumi)

## Dependencies
- Can run in parallel with other tasks as this is cross-cutting infrastructure
- Requires coordination with all development tasks for test integration
- Security reviews should happen continuously throughout development
- Deployment infrastructure can be prepared while features are being built

## Deliverables
- Complete test suite with high coverage across all layers
- Security hardening documentation and implementation
- CI/CD pipeline configuration and documentation
- Kubernetes deployment manifests and Helm charts
- Monitoring and alerting configuration
- Performance testing results and optimization recommendations
- Security compliance report and certification
- Operational runbooks and incident response procedures
- Backup and disaster recovery documentation
- Production deployment checklist and procedures

## Notes
This task is designed to run in parallel throughout the development lifecycle rather than as a final phase. Testing should be implemented alongside feature development, security reviews should be continuous, and deployment infrastructure should be ready for frequent deployments. The parallel nature allows for iterative improvements to quality, security, and reliability throughout the project.
