# Search Infrastructure & Elasticsearch Setup

## Objective
Set up Elasticsearch infrastructure to provide advanced search capabilities, full-text search, and intelligent content indexing for research papers and platform content.

## Scope
- Elasticsearch cluster setup and configuration
- Search index design for research papers and metadata
- Full-text search implementation with relevance scoring
- Advanced search filters and faceted search
- Search analytics and query optimization
- Real-time indexing pipeline
- Search API endpoints integration
- Performance tuning and monitoring

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Elasticsearch cluster is properly configured and running
- [ ] Search indices are designed with optimal field mappings
- [ ] Full-text search works across paper content and metadata
- [ ] Advanced filters work (date range, authors, topics, etc.)
- [ ] Search results are properly ranked by relevance
- [ ] Real-time indexing updates search results immediately
- [ ] Search API endpoints are integrated with main application
- [ ] Search performance meets requirements (sub-second response)
- [ ] Search analytics track popular queries and results
- [ ] Backup and recovery procedures are in place

## Technical Requirements
- Elasticsearch 8.x cluster
- Proper index mappings and analyzers
- Search query DSL implementation
- Real-time data synchronization
- Search result pagination
- Query performance optimization
- Index lifecycle management
- Monitoring and alerting setup

## Dependencies
- Requires completion of task 001 (Database Schema & Authentication)
- Needs database schema to understand data structure
- Can run in parallel with task 002 after database foundation is ready

## Deliverables
- Elasticsearch cluster configuration
- Index mapping definitions
- Search query implementation
- Search API endpoints
- Real-time indexing pipeline
- Search analytics dashboard
- Performance monitoring setup
- Documentation for search operations

## Notes
This task can be developed in parallel with task 002 once the database foundation from task 001 is complete. The search infrastructure is independent of the main API framework but will integrate with it through dedicated search endpoints.
