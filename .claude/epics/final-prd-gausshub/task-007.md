# Task: Ticket Management System UI

## Description
Develop the complete user interface for the intelligent ticket management system with Kanban-style boards, real-time updates, AI-powered similarity matching, and advanced filtering capabilities. This includes ticket creation, editing, workflow management, and real-time collaboration features.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Kanban board interface with drag-and-drop functionality for ticket status updates
- [ ] Ticket creation form with rich text editor and file attachment support
- [ ] Advanced search and filtering with faceted search capabilities
- [ ] Real-time updates using WebSocket connections for collaborative editing
- [ ] AI similarity suggestions displaying related tickets during creation
- [ ] Ticket workflow management with status transitions and approval processes
- [ ] Comment system with @mentions and notification triggers
- [ ] Bulk operations for ticket management (assign, update status, archive)
- [ ] Responsive design optimized for both desktop and mobile workflows
- [ ] Integration with backend API for all CRUD operations

## Technical Details
- **Drag & Drop**: React DnD or @dnd-kit for smooth Kanban interactions
- **Real-time**: Socket.io client for live updates and collaborative features
- **Rich Editor**: Quill.js or TinyMCE for ticket descriptions and comments
- **File Upload**: Multi-file upload with progress indicators and preview
- **Search**: Debounced search with query suggestions and saved filters
- **State Management**: Zustand stores for tickets, filters, and real-time state
- **Virtualization**: React Window for performance with large ticket lists
- **Notifications**: Toast notifications for real-time updates and actions

### Key UI Components:
- `TicketBoard` - Main Kanban interface with column management
- `TicketCard` - Individual ticket display with quick actions
- `TicketForm` - Create/edit form with validation and auto-save
- `TicketDetail` - Full ticket view with comments and history
- `SearchFilters` - Advanced filtering with faceted search
- `SimilarityPanel` - AI suggestions showing related tickets
- `CommentThread` - Threaded comments with mentions and reactions
- `BulkActions` - Multi-select operations for batch updates

### Real-time Features:
- **Live Updates**: Tickets update instantly when modified by others
- **Collaborative Editing**: Show who's currently viewing/editing tickets
- **Presence Indicators**: Display active users on the board
- **Conflict Resolution**: Handle simultaneous edits gracefully
- **Offline Sync**: Queue actions when offline, sync when reconnected

### Files to Create:
- `src/features/tickets/` - Ticket management feature module
- `src/features/tickets/components/` - All ticket-related components
- `src/features/tickets/hooks/` - Custom hooks for ticket operations
- `src/features/tickets/store/` - Zustand stores for ticket state
- `src/features/tickets/types/` - TypeScript interfaces for tickets
- `src/features/tickets/utils/` - Utility functions and helpers

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 002 (Backend Foundation) - Ticket API endpoints and WebSocket setup
- [ ] Task 004 (React Frontend Core) - Base components and routing
- [ ] AI similarity matching API endpoints
- [ ] File upload service configuration
- [ ] WebSocket server for real-time features

## Effort Estimate
- Size: XL
- Hours: 60-75 hours
- Parallel: true (can develop alongside other frontend features after API contracts)
