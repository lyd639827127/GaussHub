# Task: React Frontend Core Components

## Description
Set up the React 18 frontend foundation with TypeScript, Ant Design component library, and implement core UI components for the GaussHub platform. This includes the main application shell, navigation, routing, and shared components that will be used across all features.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] React 18 + TypeScript project structure established with Vite build system
- [ ] Ant Design 5.x integrated with custom theming for enterprise branding
- [ ] Zustand state management configured for TypeScript-first development
- [ ] React Router v6 implemented with protected routes and code-splitting
- [ ] Core layout components created (Header, Sidebar, Footer, Layout)
- [ ] Authentication flow components (Login, Registration, Password Reset)
- [ ] Error boundary components with proper error handling and logging
- [ ] Loading states and skeleton components for better UX
- [ ] Responsive design utilities and breakpoint management
- [ ] Component library documentation with Storybook setup

## Technical Details
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript 5.x and strict mode enabled
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized production builds
- **UI Library**: Ant Design 5.x with custom theme configuration
- **State Management**: Zustand for lightweight, TypeScript-first state management
- **Routing**: React Router v6 with lazy loading and route-based code splitting
- **Styling**: CSS-in-JS with styled-components and Ant Design theming
- **Testing**: Jest + React Testing Library for unit and integration tests
- **Code Quality**: ESLint + Prettier with custom rules for React/TypeScript

### Key Components to Implement:
- `AppLayout` - Main application shell with responsive sidebar
- `ProtectedRoute` - Route wrapper for authentication checks
- `ErrorBoundary` - Global error handling with user-friendly fallbacks
- `LoadingSpinner` - Reusable loading indicators with different sizes
- `Header` - Navigation header with user menu and notifications
- `Sidebar` - Collapsible navigation menu with active state management
- `AuthForm` - Shared authentication form components

### Files to Create:
- `src/components/` - Core component directory structure
- `src/layouts/` - Layout components for different page types
- `src/hooks/` - Custom React hooks for common functionality
- `src/utils/` - Utility functions and constants
- `src/types/` - TypeScript type definitions
- `src/theme/` - Custom Ant Design theme configuration

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 002 (Backend Foundation) - API endpoints for authentication
- [ ] Design system specifications from UX team
- [ ] Brand guidelines and color palette
- [ ] Figma designs for core layouts and components

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 40-50 hours
- Parallel: true (can run alongside backend development after API contracts defined)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] React application builds without errors in development and production
- [ ] All core components render correctly across different screen sizes
- [ ] Authentication flow works with backend API integration
- [ ] Error boundaries catch and display errors appropriately
- [ ] Loading states provide clear feedback during async operations
- [ ] Code follows established TypeScript and React best practices
- [ ] Unit tests achieve >80% coverage for core components
- [ ] Storybook documentation covers all shared components
- [ ] Performance audit shows no critical issues (Lighthouse score >90)
- [ ] Accessibility audit passes WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved by frontend team lead
