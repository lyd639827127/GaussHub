# Task: Mobile Interface & PWA Setup

## Description
Implement Progressive Web App (PWA) capabilities and mobile-first responsive design for the GaussHub platform. This includes offline functionality, mobile-optimized interfaces, push notifications, and touch-optimized interactions specifically designed for field engineers and mobile users.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] PWA manifest configured with proper app icons and metadata
- [ ] Service worker implemented for offline functionality and caching strategy
- [ ] Mobile-first responsive design implemented across all breakpoints
- [ ] Touch-optimized UI components with proper gesture support
- [ ] Offline data synchronization for critical features (tickets, checklists)
- [ ] Push notification system integrated with backend services
- [ ] Mobile app installation prompts and onboarding flow
- [ ] Camera integration for photo documentation and file uploads
- [ ] GPS location services for field validation workflows
- [ ] Device-specific optimizations (iOS Safari, Android Chrome)

## Technical Details
- **PWA Framework**: Workbox for service worker management and caching
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with CSS Grid and Flexbox
- **Offline Storage**: IndexedDB with Dexie.js for structured data caching
- **Push Notifications**: Web Push API with VAPID key authentication
- **Media Capture**: MediaDevices API for camera and microphone access
- **Location Services**: Geolocation API with fallback to IP-based location
- **Touch Interactions**: React Touch events with gesture recognition
- **Performance**: Lighthouse PWA audit score >90

### Key Mobile Features:
- **Offline Ticket Management**: Create and edit tickets without internet
- **Field Checklists**: Touch-optimized validation workflows with photo capture
- **Quick Actions**: Swipe gestures for common operations (archive, approve, etc.)
- **Voice Notes**: Audio recording for field documentation
- **Barcode Scanning**: Product identification using device camera
- **Location Tagging**: Automatic GPS coordinates for field activities

### PWA Components:
- `ServiceWorkerManager` - Handles SW registration and updates
- `OfflineSync` - Manages data synchronization when back online
- `PushNotifications` - Web push notification handling
- `CameraCapture` - Photo and barcode scanning interface
- `LocationTracker` - GPS location services with permissions
- `InstallPrompt` - Native app installation flow

### Files to Create:
- `public/sw.js` - Service worker with caching strategies
- `public/manifest.json` - PWA manifest with app metadata
- `src/pwa/` - PWA-specific utilities and components
- `src/mobile/` - Mobile-optimized components and layouts
- `src/offline/` - Offline functionality and sync logic

## Dependencies
- [ ] Backend API endpoints support offline-first design patterns
- [ ] Push notification server configuration (VAPID keys)
- [ ] CDN setup for static asset caching
- [ ] SSL certificate for HTTPS requirement (PWA prerequisite)

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 35-45 hours
- Parallel: true (can develop alongside other frontend components)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] PWA manifest passes validation and allows app installation
- [ ] Service worker caches resources efficiently with appropriate strategies
- [ ] Application works offline for core features (view tickets, checklists)
- [ ] Push notifications deliver successfully on both desktop and mobile
- [ ] Mobile interface is touch-friendly with appropriate hit targets (44px minimum)
- [ ] Camera integration captures and uploads photos successfully
- [ ] GPS location services work with proper permission handling
- [ ] Application performs well on 3G networks (< 3s load time)
- [ ] Lighthouse PWA audit score > 90 with no critical issues
- [ ] Cross-platform testing completed on iOS Safari and Android Chrome
- [ ] Offline sync resolves conflicts appropriately when reconnecting
- [ ] Installation prompt appears and functions correctly on supported browsers
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved with focus on mobile performance
