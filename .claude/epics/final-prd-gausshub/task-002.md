# Database Schema & Authentication Foundation

## Objective
Establish the foundational database schema and authentication system that will support all other components of the GaussHub platform.

## Scope
- PostgreSQL database setup and configuration
- Core database schema design (users, roles, permissions, research papers, etc.)
- JWT-based authentication system
- Role-based access control (RBAC) implementation
- Database migration system
- Connection pooling and optimization

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] PostgreSQL database is properly configured and running
- [ ] Complete database schema is implemented with proper relationships
- [ ] User registration and login functionality works
- [ ] JWT token generation and validation is implemented
- [ ] RBAC system allows different permission levels (admin, researcher, viewer)
- [ ] Database migrations system is in place
- [ ] Connection pooling is configured for optimal performance
- [ ] All database operations are properly secured against SQL injection

## Technical Requirements
- PostgreSQL 14+ as primary database
- bcrypt for password hashing
- JWT for authentication tokens
- Database connection pooling (pg-pool or similar)
- Proper indexing for performance
- Foreign key constraints for data integrity

## Dependencies
None - This is a foundational task that blocks other development

## Deliverables
- Database schema files
- Authentication middleware
- User management API endpoints
- RBAC permission system
- Database migration scripts
- Connection configuration

## Notes
This task is critical path and must be completed before other API development can proceed. The authentication system will be used by all subsequent features.
