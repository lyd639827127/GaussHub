# Project Brief

## Project Overview
**GaussHub** is a strategic digital transformation initiative to create a comprehensive market enablement and intelligence platform for Kunthyme's 3D Hall sensor business unit. The platform addresses critical gaps in technical sales support, knowledge management, and market intelligence that currently limit the company's Design-in success rates and customer satisfaction.

## Business Problem Statement

### Current Challenges
- **Fragmented Support Process**: Customer technical inquiries scattered across multiple channels with inconsistent response quality
- **Knowledge Silos**: Critical technical expertise locked in individual FAE minds, not systematically captured or shared
- **Design-in Inefficiencies**: Lack of standardized tools and processes for magnetic circuit design and validation
- **Limited Market Intelligence**: Insufficient data-driven insights for strategic decision-making and competitive positioning
- **Scalability Constraints**: Manual processes that cannot scale with business growth

### Impact of Status Quo
- **Customer Experience**: Inconsistent and delayed technical support affecting customer satisfaction
- **Sales Performance**: Suboptimal Design-in conversion rates due to process inefficiencies
- **Resource Utilization**: FAE time wasted on repetitive tasks and information searching
- **Strategic Decision-Making**: Lack of data-driven insights limiting competitive advantage

## Project Scope & Objectives

### Primary Objectives
1. **Accelerate Design-in Process**: Reduce customer response times by 40% and improve conversion rates by 25%
2. **Centralize Knowledge Management**: Create comprehensive, searchable repository of technical solutions
3. **Enable Data-Driven Decisions**: Provide business intelligence for strategic market positioning
4. **Scale Technical Support**: Establish scalable processes supporting business growth

### Key Success Criteria
- **MA-DI Growth**: 30% increase in Monthly Active Design-in Projects within 12 months
- **Response Time**: First response time reduction from current baseline to <4 hours
- **Knowledge Reuse**: 60% of technical solutions sourced from knowledge base
- **User Adoption**: 90% active usage rate among target user groups
- **ROI Achievement**: Positive ROI within 18 months of deployment
