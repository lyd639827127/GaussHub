# Project Progress Status

## Current Status
- **Phase**: Pre-development planning and documentation phase
- **Git Status**: Not a git repository (needs initialization)
- **Branch**: N/A (no git repo)
- **Last Activity**: Documentation creation and requirements analysis

## Recent Work Completed
- ✅ Market Requirements Document (MRD) created - comprehensive analysis
- ✅ Product Requirements Document (PRD) created - detailed specifications
- ✅ MRD-PRD alignment document created - integrated requirements
- ✅ Improved PRD documentation - enhanced specifications
- ✅ Claude Code PM system initialized
- ✅ CLAUDE.md configuration file established with development guidelines
- ✅ Initial context documentation framework established

## Current Deliverables
- **Documentation**: 8 requirement and planning documents totaling ~100KB
- **Configuration**: Claude Code PM system setup completed
- **Guidelines**: Development standards and coding rules established

## Immediate Next Steps
1. **Initialize Git Repository**
   - Run `git init` to create version control
   - Create initial commit with current documentation
   - Set up branching strategy

2. **Architecture Planning**
   - Create technical architecture document
   - Define system components and interactions
   - Plan database schema design

3. **Development Environment Setup**
   - Set up Node.js/React development environment
   - Configure TypeScript and build tools
   - Establish testing framework

4. **MVP Development Planning**
   - Break down V1.0 features into development tasks
   - Create sprint planning structure
   - Establish development milestones

## Blockers & Dependencies
- **Git Repository**: Project needs git initialization for version control
- **Technology Stack**: Need to validate and install required dependencies
- **Development Environment**: Local development setup not yet configured

## Key Metrics
- **Documentation**: 8 files created, comprehensive requirements captured
- **Planning Completion**: ~80% (requirements done, technical planning needed)
- **Development Readiness**: ~20% (documentation ready, implementation pending)

## Notes
- Project has very strong documentation foundation
- Clear business case and user requirements established
- Technical architecture specifications well-defined
- Ready to transition from planning to development phase
